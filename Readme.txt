All of the files I worked on are within Blueprints/VSU/BP with the exception of the addtional MenuMap I created, which is located in ThirdPerson/Map.

Controls are now listed in the main menu with the click of a button. Only addition input is Q, which now loads a pause menu.

Same story, you're playing a student trying to get to Steven's class on time, 
but you keep dropping important items when random thoughts (in the form of thought-cloud) collide with you.
