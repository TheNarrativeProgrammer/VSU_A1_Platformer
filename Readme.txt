You made two major life decisions, attend VFS and stop taking your ADHD medication. Steven, your instructor has said this is the last time you can be late. Unfortunately, 
random thoughts (in the form of thought bubbles) keep clouding your mind and cause you to forget import things like your wallet, bus pass and key fob.

Your goal is to make it to Steven's two classes on time. Keep playing because the times of the classes will change on each play.

Avoid the clouds. If one hits you, you'll drop an item. You can go pick it up after you drop it. Some items will be important.
